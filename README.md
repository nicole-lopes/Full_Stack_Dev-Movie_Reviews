This full-stack development project is a movie review application built using React for the frontend, Java and Spring Boot for the backend, and MongoDB as a database. The application is designed with a clear separation of concerns, allowing the frontend and backend to evolve independently. This architecture enhances flexibility and scalability, as the client-side and server-side components are loosely coupled. React handles the user interface, providing a seamless experience for browsing movies, while Spring Boot manages backend services such as movie and review data retrieval. MongoDB stores the data, ensuring efficient access and scalability for handling large movie collections. The app also supports creating and reading reviews, with the backend exposed via RESTful APIs and tested using Postman. CORS policies are configured to allow requests from a specific origin (localhost:3000), facilitating secure communication between the client and server. This project demonstrates building a complete, scalable web application using modern technologies in both frontend and backend development.
